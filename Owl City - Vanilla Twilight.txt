[Verse 1]
C              G
The stars lean down to kiss you,
Am              F
And I lie awake and miss you,
C         G              Am            F
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere.
C                   G
Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly,
Am                 F
But I'll miss your arms around me
C           G                    Dm
I'll send a postcard to you dear,
             F
Cause I wish you were here.

[Verse 2]
C           G
I watch the night turn light blue,
Am                    F
But it's not the same without you,
C                G              Dm       F
Because it takes two to whisper quietly,
C                G
The silence isn't so bad,
Am                     F
Till I look at my hands and feel sad,
C                G
Cause the spaces between my fingers
Dm                         F
Are right where yours fit perfectly.
C         G
I'll find repose in new ways,
Am               F
Though I haven't slept in two days,
C          G                Dm             F
Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone.
C               G
But drenched in Vanilla twilight,
Am              F
I'll sit on the front porch all night,
C             G               Dm
Waist deep in thought because when I think of you.
F                     F C G
I don't feel so alone.
G                     Dm C F
I don't feel so alone.
G                     Dm C F
I don't feel so alone.
Am           G#/Am      G     F#/G     F      F7
As many times as I blink I'll think of you... tonight.
Em F G x4
I'll think of you tonight.

[Verse 3]  *KEY CHANGE*
D           A
When violet eyes get brighter,
Bm           G
And heavy wings grow lighter,
D              A            Em         G
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again.
D                   A
And I'll forget the world that I knew,
Bm                  G
But I swear I won't forget you,
D        A                     Em                 G
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past,
                    A
I'd whisper in your ear,
A
Oh darling I wish you were here.
