Strumming D-D-UD-U

[Intro]
|Em|G |D |Em|

[Verse]
Now the pale morning sings of forgotten things                                      |Em|G |D |Em|
She plays a tune for those who wish to overlook                                     |Em|G |Em|Em|
The fact that they'd been blindly deceived by those who preach and pray and teach   |Em|G |D |Em|
But she falls short and the night explodes with laughter                            |Em|G |Em|Em|

Don’t you come here and say I didn’t warn you                   |Em|G |D |Em|
About the way your world can alter                              |Em|G |Em|Em|
And oh, how you try to command it all, still                    |Em|G |D |Em|
Every single time it all shifts one way or another              |Em|G |Em|Em|

[Chorus]
And I’m a goddamn coward, but then again so are you             |C |G |D |Em|
And the lion’s roar, the lion’s roar                            |C |G |D |Em|
Has me evading and hollering for you                            |C |G |D |Em|
And I never really knew, what to do                             |C |G |D |Em|

[Instrumental]
|Em|G |D |Em|

[Verse]
Now I guess sometimes I wish you were a little more predictable |Em|G |D |Em|
That I could read you just like a book                          |Em|G |Em|Em|
For now I can only guess what’s coming next                     |Em|G |D |Em|
By examining your timid smile                                   |Em|G |Em|Em|

And the ways that the old, old wind, blowin’ you back around    |Em|G |D |Em|

[Chorus]
And I’m a goddamn fool, but then again so are you               |C |G |D |Em|
And the lion’s roar, the lion’s roar                            |C |G |D |Em|
Has me singing out and searching for you                        |C |G |D |Em|
And I never really knew, what to do                             |C |G |D |Em|

[Instrumental]
|Em|G |D |Em|
|Em|G |D |Em|

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wish I could find my rose mary hill                 |A7|A7|C |C |Em|Em|Em|Em|
I sit there and look at the deserted lakes and I’d sing         |A7|A7|C |C |Em|Em|Em|Em|
And every once in a while I’d sing a song for you               |C |G |D |Em|
That would rise above the mountains and the stars and the sea   |C |G |D |Em|
And if I wanted it to, it would lead you back to me             |C |--|--|--|Em|Em|Em|Em|

[Chorus]
(STRUM ONLY ONCE ALL)
And the lion’s roar, the lion’s roar                            |C |G |D |Em|
Is something that I have heard before                           |C |G |D |Em|
a children’s tale, the lonesome wail                            |C |G |D |Em|
of a liiiiion’s roar                                            |Em|G |D |Em|

[Outro]
