capo on 5


[Intro]
Em G D Em


[Verse]
         Em            G       D          Em
Now the pale morning sings of forgotten things
             Em                 G           Em
She plays a tune for those who wish to overlook
               Em             G               D                    Em
The fact that they'd been blindly deceived by those who preach and pray and teach
      Em                     G                   Em
But she falls short and the night explodes with laughter

           Em            G      D         Em
Don’t you come here and say I didn’t warn you
          Em         G       Em
About the way your world can alter
    Em            G        D            Em
And oh, how you try to command it all, still
     Em                          G           Em
Every single time it all shifts one way or another


[Chorus]
           C         G               D           Em
And I’m a goddamn coward, but then again so are you
         C       G       D        Em
And the lion’s roar, the lion’s roar
       C         G     D        Em
As we evaded and hollering for you
       C      G     D              Em
And I never really knew, what to do


[Instrumental]
Em G D Em

[Verse]
        Em                G               D             Em
Now I guess sometimes I wish you were a little more predictable
     Em                G           Em
That I could read you just like a book
       Em      G          D             Em
For now I can only guess what’s coming next
     Em            G        D
By examining your    timid    smile
         Em           G        D                              Em
And the ways that the old, old wind, blowin’ you back around


[Chorus]
          C        G              D           Em
And I’m a goddamn fool, but then again so are you
         C       G         D     Em
And the lion’s roar, the lion’s roar
        C               G     D       Em
Has me singing out and searching for you
       C     G      D                Em
And I never really knew, what to do

[Instrumental]
Em G D Em
Em G D Em

[Bridge]
A7                        C                Em
Sometimes I wish I could find my rose mary hill
  A7                        C                     Em
I sit there and look at the deserted lakes and I’d sing
          C          G        D               Em
And every once in a while I’d sing a song for you
           C               G                 D             Em
That would rise above the mountains and the stars and the sea
          C                                        Em
And if I wanted it to, it would lead you back to me

[Chorus]
(STRUM ONLY ONCE ALL)
        C      G         D       Em
And the lion’s roar, the lion’s roar
    C             G       D       Em
Is something that I have heard before
   C          G         D       Em
a children’s tale, the lonesome wail
Em   G    D           Em
of a liiiiion’s roar
