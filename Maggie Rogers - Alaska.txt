[Verse]						|C |C |C |C |		D-UDUD-UDUD-DU
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

[Pre-chorus]					|F |C |Am|Am|		D-UDUD-UDUD-DU
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me oh my I thought it was a dream		
So it seemed

[Chorus]					|F |Am|Em7|Em7|		D-UDUD-UDUD-DU
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between

[Verse]						|C |C |C |C |		D-UDUD-UDUD-DU
Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

[Pre-chorus]					|F |C |Am|Am|		D-UDUD-UDUD-DU
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me...
Oh me oh my I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]					|F |Am|Em7|Em7|		D-UDUD-UDUD-DU
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
