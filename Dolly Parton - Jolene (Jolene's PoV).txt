[Chorus]
  Am     C      G      Am
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly
    G                              Am
You really think I wanna take your man?
  Am      C       G      Am
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly
  G                Em           Am
I tell you but you never understand

[Verse]
       Am        C
Your beauty is beyond compare
     G              Am
With sunny skin and platinum hair
     G               Em               Am
With cherry lips and eyes wide as the sea
       Am             C
Your laugh is like a morning dove
       G                  Am
Your smile makes strangers fall in love
       G         Em             Am
And I just wanna worship you, Dolly

[Verse]
    Am             C
Your heart is locked, he's got the key
     G                Am
And now he thinks that he wants me
       G             Em               Am
I curse him when he grabs your waist, Dolly
    Am            C
And you can't seem to understand
    G                 Am
Why I tell you to leave that man
            G                  Em          Am
'Cause you don't know what you mean to me, Dolly

[Chorus]
  Am     C      G      Am
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly
    G                              Am
You really think I wanna take your man?
  Am      C       G      Am
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly
  G                Em           Am
I tell you but you never understand

[Verse]
Am                    C
I could have my choice of men
    G                Am
But, God, I'll never love again
   G           Em             Am
If he's the only one for you, Dolly
   Am               C
You tell me 'bout your jealousy
    G           Am
And what you really think of me
  G                   Em      Am
I guess I'm just your misery, Dolly

[Chorus]
  Am     C      G      Am
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly
    G                              Am
You really think I wanna take your man?
  Am      C       G      Am
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, Dolly
  G                Em           Am
I tell you but you never understand
