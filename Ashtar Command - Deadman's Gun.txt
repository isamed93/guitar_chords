[Intro]
C G Am F x4

[Verse]
C           G
Your hand's upon
Am          F
a deadman's gun and you're
C          G     Am      F
lookin' down the sights

C             G
Your heart is worn,
Am                F
and the seams are torn, and they've
C           G
given you a reason
   Am     F
to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
           C         G
And you're not gonna take what they've
Am     F
got to give
           C         G
And you're not gonna let 'em take your
Am      F
will to live, because
        C          G
they've taken enough
           Am         F
and you've given them all you can give
C              G               Am   F
and luck won't save them tonight

C                   G
They've given you a reason
   Am     F
to fight

[Chorus]
G
And all the storms you've been chasin'
F                        C
about to rain down tonight
G
And all the pain you've been facin'
F                          C
about to come into the light

[Outro]
C G Am F [Repeat until fade out]
