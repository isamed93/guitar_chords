* = one strum

[Verse]
Em              C   Am
  The mirror's image  tells me it's home time
Em              C    Am
  But I'm not finished 'cause you're not by my side
Em           C                     Am
  And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving, carrying your shoes
Em             C                     Am
  Decided that once again I was just dreaming of bumping into you

[Chorus]
Em    C                 Am
  Now it's three in the morning
        D                     Em
And I'm trying to change your mind
          C              Am
Left you multiple missed calls
          D              Em
And to my message, you reply
C*                                 Am
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Em    C                                  Am
High, why'd you only call me when you're high?

[Verse]
Em             C   Am
  Somewhere darker, talking the same shite
Em             C   Am
  I need a partner, well, are you out tonight?
Em                C                    Am
  It's harder and harder to get you to listen, more I get through the beers
Em             C              Am                  (pause)
  Incapable of making alright decisions and having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Em    C                 Am
  Now it's three in the morning
         D                    Em
And I'm trying to change your mind
          C              Am
Left you multiple missed calls
          D              Em
And to my message, you reply
C                                  Am
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Em    C                                  Am
High, why'd you only call me when you're high?

[Bridge]
              Em               C              Am
  And I can't see you here, wondering where I might
           Em                 C          Am
  It sorta feels like I'm running out of time
            Em               C         Am
  I haven't found what I was hoping to find
                     B*
  You said you gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
    B*
And you're starting to bore me, baby, why'd you only call me when you're high?

[Bridge]
C    Em
C    Em
C    Em
C    Em

[Outro]
          C         Am                  Em
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
          C         Am                  Em
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
          C         Am                  Em
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
           C        Am                  B7*
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're

High?
