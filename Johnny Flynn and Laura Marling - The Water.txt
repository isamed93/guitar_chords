Strumming: (Base)-D-DUs
[Intro]
C G C F
C G Am F


[Verse]
C          G         F
All that I have is a river
    Am                E
The river is always my home
      C         F        Am          F
Lord, take me away for I just cannot stay
        C          Dm           F
Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones

[Chorus]
    C        G           C         F
The water sustains me without even trying
    C            G            Am
The water can't drown me, I'm done
        F     C
With my dyy...ing


[Verse]
C              G             F
Please help me build a small boat
Am                        E
One that'll ride on the flow
          C          F             Am          F
Where the river runs deep, and the larger fish creep
    C            Dm        F
I'm glad of what keeps me afloat


[Chorus]
    C        G           C         F
The water sustains me without even trying
    C            G            Am
The water can't drown me, I'm done
        F     C
With my dyy...ing


[Verse]
C              G       F
Now deeper the water I sail
    Am                     E
And faster the current I'm in
         C                F
But each night brings the stars
        Am         F
And the song in my heart
     C            Dm           F
Is a tune for the journeyman's tale


[Chorus]
    C        G           C         F
The water sustains me without even trying
    C            G            Am
The water can't drown me, I'm done
        F
With my dyy...ing


[Bridge]

        E                       Am
Now the land that I knew is a dream
        E                           Am
And the line on the distance grows faint
   C          Dm           C       Dm
So wide is my river, the horizon a sliver
    C          G          F
The artist has run out of paint


[Verse]
            C         G             F
Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
          Am                    E
And the big yellow sun leads me home
    C          F         Am      F
I'm everywhere now, the way is a vow
       C            Dm             F
To the wind of each breath by and by


[Chorus]
    C        G           C         F
The water sustains me without even trying
    C            G            Am
The water can't drown me, I'm done
        F     C
With my dyy...ing
