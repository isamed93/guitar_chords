[Verse 1]
C     G               Am    F
 Just one drop in the ocean
C       G         Am       F          C
 Turned me into a reckless tidal wave
    G                Am     F
Car crashing in slow motion
    Am              G                C   F
You want to but you just can't look away

[Verse 2]
Am                 G               C
See through in pink, one more drink
        F            Am           G      F
For the silent silhouette sitting in the hall
Am            G               C            F
You never talk 'cause you know that's what draws me to you
Am         G              C F
Even when I wish for more

[Chorus]
F            G           C
 You like me more when I need you
   F            G                C        G
And, I need you more than I'm supposed to do
   Am            G              C    F
So, tell me what happens in the end?
Am           G          C   F
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn

[Verse 3]
C    G               Am       F
 You wear me well at midnight
C       G               Am         F               C
 I hang on your arm and laugh with all your friends
           G             Am          F
You're fluorescent under city lights
Am                   G          C       F
At your best, you're magic even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
F            G           C
 You like me more when I need you
   F            G                C        G
And, I need you more than I'm supposed to do
    Am           G              C   F
So, tell me what happens in the end?
Am           G           C F
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
Am           G           C F
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn

[Bridge]
F G             Am          C
  I need you more than I want to
F G Am C F
G              Am            C
You need me more than you say you do
F G Am C F
G                  Am                F G C G
Tell me, now what, happens in the end?
G                  Am                F G C G
Tell me, now what, happens in the end?

[Chorus]
F            G           C
 You like me more when I need you (I need you more than I want to)
    F            G               C         G
And, I need you more than I'm supposed to do (You need me more than you say you do)
    Am           G                 C F
So, tell me what happens in the end? (Oh, tell me what happens?)
Am           G           C F
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
F G            Am             C
  I like you more when I'm lonely
F G Am C F
G            Am            C         F

You like me more when I'm on my knees
Am           G                C F
Tell me what happens in the end?
Am          G          C F
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
