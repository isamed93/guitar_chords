[Intro]
| F  C  | G  Am |

[Verse 1]
F               C
I've sat at the bleachers
G         Am
 Watching life unfold
F            C
 I've been a bystander
G     Am         F
 To a sight to behold
                C
I've played the victim
G               Am
I'm the one who let it burn
F             C
 If you don't fuck up
G                 Am
 Well then you'll never learn
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Dm        C   G
And I've been ruminating
Dm       C     G
Things I never said

[Chorus]
F                     C
 We used to chase the sun
                    G
We used to have our fun
                  Am                F
We were two young fools, oh kids in love
                      C
Before your change of heart
                  G
Before it all got dark
                  Am                F
We were two young fools, oh kids in love

[Post-Chorus]
       C                G
Oh I-I-I'm still living there
N.C.
This time I'll make it last

[Verse 2]
    F                  C
Now you're the perfect father
G             Am
 To kids that aren't mine
F            C
 Saw you got married
G            Am               F
 So handsome in your suit and tie
C        G        Am
 And you couldn't help me
F            C
 I'd make it up to you
G            Am
 If you were by my side
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Dm        C   G
And I've been ruminating
Dm       C     G
Things I never said

[Chorus]
F                     C
 We used to chase the sun
                    G
We used to have our fun
                  Am                F
We were two young fools, oh kids in love
                      C
Before your change of heart
                  G
Before it all got dark
                  Am                F
We were two young fools, oh kids in love

[Post-Chorus]
       C                G
Oh I-I-I'm still living there
Am
 This time I'll make it last
 
[Bridge]
Dm                Am
 And I will never give up
C               F
 You will never know
Dm                      Am
 I'll keep living in my mind still
C                                      C
Where our love grows old and just goes on and on and

[Chorus]
F                     C
 We used to chase the sun
                    G
We used to have our fun
                  Am                F
We were two young fools, oh kids in love
                      C
Before your change of heart
                  G
Before it all got dark
                  Am                F
We were two young fools, oh kids in love

[Post-Chorus]
       C                G
Oh I-I-I'm still living there
Am         N.C.
 This time I'll make it last
