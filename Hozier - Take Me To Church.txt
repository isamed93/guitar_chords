is a great acoustic version of this song that I based this tab off.
In the chorus a B or B7 is fine depending if you're playing the original or acoustic version.

B7  = x2120x in Hozier's version
A5  = 57xxxx
G5  = 35xxxx
F#5 = 24xxxx
F5  = 13xxxx

[Verse 1]
Em                Am     Em
   My lover's got humour
                      Am      G
She's the giggle at a funeral
                       Am     Em
Knows everybody's disapproval
                           Am     Em
I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am        Em
If the heavens ever did speak
                    Am         G
She's the last true mouthpiece
                       Am        Em
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
               Am        D
A fresh poison each week
                  C
We were born sick, you heard them say it

Em                     Am      Em
   My church offers no absolutes
                              Am      G
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
                        Am      Em
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                  Am       D
Is when I'm alone with you
                C
I was born sick, but I love it
C
Command me to be well
      G     C     G     Cm    G    Cm  G    G5 F#5
Aaaaaaaaaa  Aaaaaaamen  Aaaaaamen  A - men

[Chorus]
F#5  F5       Em
Take me to church
                                               B7
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                 G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
          Em                       A5 G5
And good God, let me give you my life
G5   F#5      Em
Take me to church
                                               B7
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                 G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Am
Offer me that deathless death
         Em                        A5 G5  G5 F#5
And good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
Em                       Am      Em
   If I'm a pagan of the good times
               Am      G
My lover's the sunlight
                       Am   Em
To keep the goddess on my side
              Am
She demands sacrifice
D
  To drain the whole sea
C
  Get something shiny

Em                         Am          Em
   Something meaty for the main course
                      Am         G
That's a fine looking high horse
                    Am      Em
What you got in the stable?
                        Am
We've a lot of starving faithful
D
  That looks tasty
C
  That looks plenty
C
  This is hungry work

G5 F#5

                                                 G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

And good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
C/G            G                 B7           Em
    No masters or kings when the ritual begins
         C/G        G              B7         Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
       C/G           G          B7          Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C/G       G
Only then I am human
     B7           Em    D    C
Only then I am clean
 G   C  G    Cm  G     Cm  G     G5 F#5
Oh, a - men  A - men  Aa-aa-men

[Chorus]

I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                              G
I'll tell you my sins, you can sharpen your knife
              Am
