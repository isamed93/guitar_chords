Recommended chord pattern:
     Cm   Fm   Gm   Eb   D
e|---3----1----3----6----5-----------|
B|---4----1----3----8----7-----------|
G|---5----1----3----8----7-----------|
D|---5----3----5----8----7-----------|
A|---3----3----5----6----5-----------|
E|---x----1----3----x----x-----------|
(So, all bars that's what I'm trying to say)

There is only two small riffs, one before the Cm, and one before the Fm
