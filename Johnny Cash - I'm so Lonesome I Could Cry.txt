C7 x32310

[Intro]
C                  Am     C
Hear that lonesome Whipoorwill,
   C          Am      C    C7
He sounds too blue to fly,
    F                 Am      C
The midnight train is whinin' low,
    C           G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

     C            Am       C
I've never seen a night so long,
     C         Am       C   C7
When time goes crawlin' by,
    F                Am     C
The moon just went behind a cloud,
   C        G7       C
To hide its face and cry.

C                  Am    C
Did you ever see a robin weep,
     C        Am     C    C7
When leaves begin to die,
     F               Am          C
That means he's lost the will to live
       C        G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

    C            Am      C
The silence of a fallin' star,
       C    Am     C     C7
Lights up a purple sky,
    F           Am        C
And as I wonder where you are,
       C        G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry,
       C        G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry.
