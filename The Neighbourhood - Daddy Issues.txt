Capo 3
[Intro]
Am Em G x2

[Verse 1]
Am   Em       G
Take you like a drug
  Am    Em       G
I taste you on my tongue

[Hook]
C                               Am
  You ask me what I'm thinking about
                              Em
I tell you that I'm thinking about
                          G
Whatever you're thinking about
C                                Am
  Tell me something that I'll forget
                               Em
And you might have to tell me again
                                G
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus]
             Am
Go ahead and cry little girl
               Em
Nobody does it like you do
                   G
I know how much it matters to you

I know that you got daddy issues
                Am
And if you were my little girl
                Em
I'd do whatever I could do
                 G
I'd run away and hide with you

I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

[Verse 2]
Em                                  G
  I tried to write your name in the rain

But the rain never came
                   Am
So I made with the sun

The shade
Em                    G
  Always comes at the worst time

[Hook]
C                               Am
  You ask me what I'm thinking about
                              Em
I tell you that I'm thinking about
                          G
Whatever you're thinking about
C                                Am
  Tell me something that I'll forget
                               Em
And you might have to tell me again
                             G
It's crazy what you do for a friend

[Chorus]
             Am
Go ahead and cry little girl
               Em
Nobody does it like you do
                   G
I know how much it matters to you

I know that you got daddy issues
                Am
And if you were my little girl
                Em
I'd do whatever I could do
                 G
I'd run away and hide with you

I know that you got daddy issues

[Verse 3]
                    Am
I keep on trying to let you go
             G
I'm dying to let you know
       D            G
How I'm getting on
                      Am
I didn't cry when you left at first
                    Em           G
But now that you're dead it hurts
          D
This time I gotta know
             G
Where did my daddy go?
                 Am    Em
I'm not entirely here
                    D     G
Half of me has disappeared

[Chorus 2]
             Em             Am
Go ahead and cry, little boy
                   Em
You know that your daddy did too
                   G
You know what your mama went through

You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

[Chorus]
             Am
Go ahead and cry little girl
               Em
Nobody does it like you do
                   G
I know how much it matters to you

I know that you got daddy issues
                Am
And if you were my little girl
                Em
I'd do whatever I could do
                 G
I'd run away and hide with you

I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

[Outro]
C  Am  Em  G
(repeat and fade out)
