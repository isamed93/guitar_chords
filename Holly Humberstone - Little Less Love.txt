Capo I

[Verse 1]
      Em           F
It's only been a week
  G               C
Still thinking about it
     Em                F
How hard you were to leave
 G                      C
Said I'll be fine but I doubt it
       Em                     F
How you're making it look so easy
 G       C             Em              F
Can you teach me how you walk out so naively
 G       C
'Cause I

[Chorus]
  Em          F                    G        C
I thought I'd be just a little bit better by now
Em           F
So sure I'd be
                      G                C
A little less of the mess that I am right now somehow
  Em                 F
Just a little bit stronger
  G                     C
Give it a little bit longer
                         Em       F
Will be forgetting all about you soon
                      G                  C
But I wish I had a little less love for you

[Post-Chorus]
 Em
A little less love
 F
A little less love
 G                      C
A little less love for you
 Em
A little less love
 F
A little less love
 G                      C
A little less love for you

[Verse 2]
    Em            F      G                             C
I wish I didn't care 'bout all the friends that you're making
          Em                  F
Cuz I'm the one you chose to spend
     G                          C                 Em
At least I'm not a heart that you;re breaking anymore
          F
Looks so easy
   G       C              Em           F
Tell me, tell me how you walk out so naively
   G     C
'Cause I

[Chorus]
 Em            F                      G         C
I thought I'd be just a little bit better by now
Em          F
So sure I'd be
                       G                 C
A little less of the mess that I am right now somehow
  Em             F
Just a little bit stronger
           G             C
Give it a little bit longer
                        Em        F
Will be forgetting all about you soon
                     G                   C
But I wish I had a little less love for you

[Post-Chorus]
 Em
A little less love
 F
A little less love
 G                      C
A little less love for you
 Em
A little less love
 F
A little less love
 G                     C
A little less love for you

[Bridge]
         Em              F
Hate to think that you don't need me
G    C              Em               F        G  C
Go ahead and just forget about me completely
     Em              F
How naive to think you'd miss me
G          C
I thought I would be
   Em               F                G*
Missing you you a little less right now
N.C.
But honestly

[Chorus]
Em            F                 G        C
I thought I'd be a little bit better by now
Em          F
So sure I'd be
                       G                  C
A little less of the mess that I am right now somehow
Em               F
Just a little bit stronger
G                 C
Give it a little bit longer
                         Em       F
Will be forgetting all about you soon
                      G                  C
But I wish I had a little less love for you

[Post-Chorus]
Em
A little less love
F
A little less love
G                       C
A little less love for you
Em
A little less love
F
A little less love
G                      C
A little less love for you

[Chorus]
 Em                  F
Just a little bit stronger
            G           C
Give it a little bit longer
                         Em        F
Will be forgetting all about you soon
                     G                   C
But I wish I had a little less love for you

[Outro]
Em F                     G                   C
    And I wish I had a little less love for you
