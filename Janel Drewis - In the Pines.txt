[Chorus]
        Am          C          Dm          F
Little girl, little girl, don't lie to me
          C              E              Am
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
        Am             C                 Dm          F
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
        E       E7               Am
We'll shiver the whole night through.

[Verse]
  Am       C      Dm         F
My Daddy was a Railroad man
          C         E             Am
Killed a mile and a half from here
Am            C             Dm          F
His head, was found, In a drivers wheel
        E       E7              Am
His body was never found.
Am                     C                 Dm          F
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
        E                 E7                  Am
We'll shiver the whole night through.
Am                    C              Dm            F
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
        E          E7           Am
You caused me to lose my home.

[Chorus]
Am                   C                  Dm              F
Little girl, little girl, where'd you sleep last night?
     C           E       Am
Not even your mother knows.
Am                    C                Dm          F
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
        E               E7                  Am
We'll shiver when the cold winds blow.
