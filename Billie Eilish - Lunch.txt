[Intro]
      Em
Oh, mm-mm

[Chorus]
        Bm
I could eat that girl for lunch
          Em
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
            Bm                   Em
Tastes like she might be the one
            Bm
And I could never get enough
        A
I could buy her so much stuff
       G                         Em
It's a craving, not a crush, huh
Bm
"Call me when you're there
         Em
Said, "I bought you somethin' rare"
      Bm                    Em
And I left it under "Claire"
              Bm
So now, she's comin' up the stairs
       A
So I'm pullin' up a chair
        G                  Em
And I'm puttin' up my hair

[Verse 1]
        Bm                        Em
Baby, I think you were made for me
         Bm                 Em
Somebody write down the recipe
            Bm               A
Been tryin' hard not to overeat
               G     Em
You're just so sweet
           Bm                      Em
I'll run a shower for you like you want
               Bm                       Em
Clothеs on the counter for you, try 'em on
         Bm                            A  G
If I'm allowеd, I'll help you take 'em off
    Em
Huh

[Chorus]
        Bm
I could eat that girl for lunch
          Em
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
            Bm                   Em
Tastes like she might be the one
            Bm
And I could never get enough
        A
I could buy her so much stuff
       G                         Em
It's a craving, not a crush, huh

[Post-Chorus]
           Bm                  Em
Oh, I just wanna get her off, oh
 Bm Em Bm
Oh
 A   G
Oh, oh
  Em
Oh

[Verse 2]
             Bm
She's takin' pictures in the mirror
      Em
Oh my God, her skin's so clear
           Bm                   Em
Tell her, "Bring that over here"
           Bm
You need a seat? I'll volunteer
          A
Now she's smilin' ear to ear
          G                        Em
She's the headlights, I'm the deer

[Bridge]
                   Bm                          Em
I've said it all before, but I'll say it again
                  Bm                              Em
I'm interested in more than just bein' your friend
              Bm                             A
I don't wanna break it, just want it to bend
                   G     Em
Do you know how to bend?

[Chorus]
        Bm                      Em
I could eat that girl for lunch
    Bm                  Em
She dances on my tongue
  Bm                     A
I know it's just a hunch
                     N.C.
But she might be the one
