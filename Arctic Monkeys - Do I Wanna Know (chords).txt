Capo: III

[Verse 1]
Em                            C     Am
 Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Em                                       C
 Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
     Am                 Em
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
                C             Am
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Em                               C
 Have you no idea that you're in deep?
         Am               Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
          C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?
Em                                    C                 Am
 Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
      Em
And I play it on repeat
C         Am
 Until I fall asleep
Em                       B
 Spilling drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
      Em
Do I wanna know
        C                 Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
       Em
Sad to see you go
          C                 Am
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      Em
Baby we both know
          C                 Am
That the nights were mainly made
             Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
                C       Am                E7?
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few
             Em
Cos I always do
          Em             C         Am            E7?
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Em
Now I've thought it through
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
                    C    Am
So have you got the guts?
Em                                   C
 Been wondering if your heart's still open
       Am         Em
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
C              Am
 Simmer down and pucker up
Em
 I'm sorry to interrupt
     C                   Am
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
   Em        C        Am
Of trying to kiss you
               Em            C       Am
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
Em            C        Am
 We could be together
Em             B
 if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
      Em
Do I wanna know
        C                 Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
       Em
Sad to see you go
          C                 Am
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      Em
Baby we both know
          C                 Am
That the nights were mainly made
             Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
                C       Am                E7?
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few
             Em
Cos I always do
          Em             C         Am           E7?
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Em
Now I've thought it through
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you


[Outro]
               C        Am      Em
Too busy being yours to fall
                C       Am      Em
Ever thought of calling darling?
               C        Am      Em
Do you want me crawling back to you?
