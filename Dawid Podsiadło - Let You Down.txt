Capo: I or II
[Intro]
Dm Am C G

[Verse 1]
         Dm
Feel the rhythm of the streets
     Am
Neon lights and neon dreams (dimming?)
       C
Bloody fists they feel no pain
               G
When thereâ€™s so much more to gain
        Dm
Hunting season if you will
        Am
Tell me where you'd rather be
      C
I can hardly see the moon
            G
Hope we'll get there pretty soon

[Pre-Chorus]
 Dm
Trying so hard to release
    Am
You out of the misery
 C
Hold on to your wishes
       G
If you can't hold on to me

[Chorus]
                Dm
Forgive me for letting you down
                Am
Forgive me for letting you down again
                 C
I guess I'm not strong enough
     G
Right now

[Bridge]
Dm Am C G

[Verse 2]
          Dm
They will finally feel the flames
            Am
Flames that run down through my veins
       C
I will make the city burn
           G
We're not planning to return

[Pre-Chorus]
 Dm
Trying so hard to be free
    Am
To make you see what I see
 C
Hold on to your wishes
       G
If you can't hold on to me

[Chorus]
                Dm
Forgive me for letting you down
                Am
Forgive me for letting you down again
                 C
I guess I'm not strong enough
     G
Right now
                Dm
Forgive me for letting you down
                Am
Forgive me for letting you down again
                 C
I guess I'm not strong enough
     G
Right now
