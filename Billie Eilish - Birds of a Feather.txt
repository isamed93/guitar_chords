Strumming: D--UD-D-D--UD-D-

[Intro]
D
 (I want you to stay)

[Verse 1]
              D
I want you to stay
                Bm
'Til I'm in the grave
            Em
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
                A
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
                     D
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
                     Bm
'Cause it was always you (Alright)
                   Em
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
                A
Nothin' left to lose without my baby

[Refrain]
D                                                    Bm
 Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
 
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Em
  Can't change the weather, might not be forever
       A
But if it's forever, it's even better

[Pre-Chorus]
D                                 Bm
 And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
                               Em
I don't think I could love you more
                                 A
It might not be long, but, baby, I

[Chorus]
                                  D
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
                    Bm
'Til the day that I die
                         Em
'Til the light leaves my eyes
                    A
'Til the day that I die

[Verse 2]
              D
I want you to see, hmm
                Bm
How you look to me, hmm
               Em
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
                   A
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
                      D
But you're so full of shit, uh
               Bm
Tell me it's a bit, oh
                  Em
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
              A
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

[Pre-Chorus]
D                                 Bm
 And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
                               Em
I don't think I could love you more
                              A
Might not be long, but, baby, I
                    D
Don't wanna say goodbye

[Chorus]
                                                                          Bm
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('Til the day that I die)
                                                                       Em
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('Til the light leaves my eyes)
                                                                    A
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('Til the day that I die)

But if it's forever, it's even better

[Post-Chorus]
D                      Bm
 I knew you in another life
                               Em
You had that same look in your eyes
                            A
I love you, don't act so surprised

[Outro]
D Bm Em A
