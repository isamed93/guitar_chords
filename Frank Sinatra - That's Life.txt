[Verse]
        G                B7
That's life, that's what all the people say
       Em                    A
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
      G              B7          Em
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
          A                           D7
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

         G            B7
That's life, and as funny as it may seem
  Em                         A
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
    G             B7        Em
But I don't let it get me down
             A                                    D7
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps me spinnin' around

[Chorus]
            G                                     B7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
          C
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
      A
Each time I find myself flat on my face
        D
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse]
        G                        B7
That's life, oh, that's life and I can't deny it
       Em                                    A
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
       G                B7                   Em
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
          A                                D7
Well, I'd hop upon a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
            G                                     B7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn, oh, and a king
          C
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
      A
Each time I find myself flat on my face
       D
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

(Here add a capo on the 1st fret)

[Verse]
        G             B7
That's life, oh, and I can't deny it
      Em                                     A
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it
       G                      B7                 Em
And if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July
                A                                   D7
Well, I'm gonna roll myself up in a little ball and die

[Outro]
         G            B7
That's life, and as funny as it may seem
  Em                         A
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
    G             B7        Em
But I don't let it get me down
             A                                    G
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps me spinnin' around
