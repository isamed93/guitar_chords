[Intro]
|G |G |B7|B7|C |C |A |A |G |G |B7|Em|A |D7|

[Verse]
That's life, that's what all the people say                                 |G |G |B7|B7|
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May                               |Em|Em|A |A |
But I know I'm gonna change that tune                                       |G |B7|Em|Em|
When I'm back on top, back on top in June                                   |A |A |D7|D7|

That's life, and as funny as it may seem                                    |G |G |B7|B7|
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream                             |Em|Em|A |A |
But I don't let it get me down                                              |G |B7|Em|Em|
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps me spinnin' around                     |A |A |D7|D7|

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king           |G |G |G7|G7|
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing                 |C |C |C |C |
Each time I find myself flat on my face                                     |A |A |A |A |
I just pick myself up and get back in the race                              |D |D |D |D |

[Verse]
That's life, oh, that's life and I can't deny it                            |G |G |B7|B7|
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it               |Em|Em|A |A |
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try                           |G |B7|Em|Em|
Well, I'd hop upon a big bird and then I'd fly                              |A |A |D7|D7|

 

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king           |G |G |G7|G7|
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing                 |C |C |C |C |
Each time I find myself flat on my face                                     |A |A |A |A |
I just pick myself up and get back in the race                              |D |D |D |D |
 

(Here add a capo on the 1st fret, the artist makes time to put it on. Just play the same chords)

 

[Verse]
That's life, oh, and I can't deny it                                        |G |G |G7|G7|
Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it               |Em|Em|A |A |
And if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July                          |G |B7|Em|Em|
Well, I'm gonna roll myself up in a little ball and die                     |A |A |D7|D7|

[Outro]
That's life, and as funny as it may seem                                    |G |G |B7|B7|
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream                             |Em|Em|A |A |
But I don't let it get me down                                              |G |B7|Em|Em|
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps me spinnin' around                     |A |A |G-|--|
