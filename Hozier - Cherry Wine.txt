Capo I
[Intro]
C        F    C

[Verse 1]
    C                  C
Her eyes and words are so icy
            Am
Oh, but she burns
     F        C
Like rum on a fire
C                C
Hot and fast and angry
   C
As she can be
Am        F         C
I walk my days on a wire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
F          Am   F         Am
  It looks ugly, but it's clean,
F    Am           Dm7        C
  Oh momma, don't fuss over me

[Chorus]
            C            Am              C
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
     C              Am            C
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
    F                 Dm7                  C
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Verse 2]
C               C
Calls of guilty thrown at me
C             Am
All while she stains
    F              C
The sheets of some other
C               C
Thrown at me so powerfully
C             Am              F          C
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother

[Pre-Chorus 2]
F       Am      F       Am
  But I want it, it's a crime
F            Am         Dm7         C
  That she's not around most of the time

[Chorus]
            C            Am              C
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
     C              Am            C
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
F                 Dm7                  C
Blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
    C              C
Her fight and fury is fiery
C           Am
Oh, but she loves
     F            C
Like sleep to the freezing
C                   C
Sweet and right and merciful
C           Am
I'm all but washed
       F           C
In the tide of her breathing

[Pre-Chorus 3]
F          Am       F       Am
  And it's worth it, it's divine
F     Am          Dm7         C
  And I have this some of the time

[Chorus]
            C            Am              C
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
     C              Am            C
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
    F                 Dm7                   C
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
