[Verse 1]
Em                         B7       Em
I watch the work of my kin bold and boyful
Em                        B7        Em
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
D                        G
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Em                          B7        Em
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

[Verse 2]
Em                        B7       Em
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
Em                  B7          Em
No more alone or myself could I be.
D                           G
Looks like a strain to the arms it were open,
Em                            B7       Em
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me.

[Chorus]
         Em                         G
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
          Em                    G
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean,
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.

[Verse 3]
Em                     B7             Em
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh,
  Em                         B7          Em
I lay my heart down with the rest at her feet.
D                           G
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile,
Em                    B7           Em
Bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet.

[Chorus]
         Em                         G
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
          Em                    G
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean,
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.

[Bridge]
Em   Bm   G     Am   C    D   G   G
Oh   Ooh  Oooh  Oh   Ooooohohoh
Am   Em   Bm    C    C    G

[Verse 4]
    Em                          B7         Em
And lease this confusion, I'll wander the concrete,
Em                   B7        Em
Wonder if better now having survived.
D                         G
Jarring of judgement and reasons defeat,
     Em                             B7         Em
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth I'm alive.

[Chorus]
         Em                         G
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
          Em                    G
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean,
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.

         Em                         G
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
          D                            Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
          Em                    G
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean,
          D                            Em             Em
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
