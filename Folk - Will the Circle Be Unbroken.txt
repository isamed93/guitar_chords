[Verse 1]
G      A   C
There are loved ones in the glory
           F               C
Whose dear forms you often miss
                           Am
When you close your earthly story
          C        G        C
Will you join them in their bliss?

[Chorus]
G     A   C
Will the Circle be unbroken
       F          C
By and by, by and by
                Am
Is a better home awaiting
         C   G     C
In the sky, in the sky

[Verse 4]
G   A   C
You can picture happy gatherings
           F             C
'Round the fireside long ago
                         Am
And you think of tearful partings
          C        G    C
when they left you here below

[Chorus]
G     A   C
Will the Circle be unbroken
       F           C
By and by, by and by
                Am
Is a better home awaiting
         C   G     C
In the sky, in the sky

[Verse 5]
G   A  C
One by one their seats were emptied
           F             C
And one by one they went away
                  Am
Now the family is parted
        C      G        C
Will it be complete one day?

[Chorus]
G     A   C
Will the Circle be unbroken
       F          C
By and by, by and by
                 Am
Is a better home awaiting
        C    G     C
In the sky, in the sky
