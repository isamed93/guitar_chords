[Verse]
Dm                   E                         Am
I just want to rewind I haven't seen you in a long time
           Em
You got me feeling so lonely
 Dm                       E
Even when you come through I can tell
        Am                Em
That it isn't you so baby bring it in closely
Dm                            E
Hate the way I love you but you're so sweet
 Am                        Em
I always find a way to say the wrong things
  Dm                              E
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
    Am                                  Em
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me

[Chorus]
         Dm  E  Am
Baby come home, home
         Dm  E7 Am
Baby come home, home
     Am  Dm  E  Am
Baby come home, home
     Am  Dm  E7 Am
Baby come home, home

[Verse]
Dm                   E                        Am
I just want to rewind I haven't seen you in a long time
            Em        Am
You got me feeling so lonely
Dm                 E
Even when you come through I can tell
        Am                Em          Am
That it isn't you so baby bring it in closely
Dm                         E
Hate the way I love you but you're so sweet

     Am                                Em
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me

[Bridge]
     Dm     E    Am     Em      Dm
I've only recently began to fall
   E           Am    Em       Dm
I feel the need to go and waste it all
  E            Am   Em       Dm
I tried to numb away the pain
        E                  Am           Em             Dm
I hope someone is watching me, watching me, watching me

[Chorus]
         Dm  E  Am
Baby come home, home
     Am  Dm  E7 Am
Baby come home, home
     Am  Dm  E7 Am
Baby come home, home
     Am  Dm  E7 Am
Baby come home, home

[Outro]
Dm E Am Em
Am Em Dm E
