There is a house in New Orleans
    Am        C     E
They call the rising sun
        Am       C      D            F
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl 
   Am      E        Am
And me, oh god, I'm one

 Am           C     D       F
If I'd listened to my mama 
    Am      C      E 
Lord I'd be home today
   Am    C          D       F
But I was young and foolish 
          Am        E   Am
A handsome rider led me astray

 Am   C       D      F
Go tell my baby sister
     Am      C      E
Never do what I have done
  Am       C        D        F
To shun the house in New Orleans
    Am       E       Am
They call the rising sun

 Am     C        D       F
My mother she's a tailor
   Am       C       E
She sewed my new blue jeans
  Am       C        D        F
My sweetheart he's a rambler 
          Am      E     Am
He seemed the man of my dreams

      Am     C       D       F
Now the only thing a rambler needs
    Am       C      E
is a suitcase and a gun
   Am    C    D       F
The only time he's satisfied
  Am        E       Am
is when he's on the run

 Am          C       D       F
He fills his chamber up with lead 
   Am        C         E
And takes his pain to town
    Am        C       D          F
Only pleasure he gets out of life
  Am           E        Am
Is bringing another man down

         Am      C       D        F
He's got one hand on the saddle
   Am     C      E
the other on the reins
        Am     C       D       F
And he's riding back to Redwood
  Am      E        Am
to break his fathers' chains

  Am      C       D         F
And me, I wait in New Orleans
   Am      C       E
The game my love has won
       Am      C       D          F
And I'm staying here to end my life
    Am      E       Am
Down in the rising sun

       Am      C       D          F
And I'm staying here to end my life
    Am      E       Am
Down in the rising sun
