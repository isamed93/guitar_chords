 [Verse]
Dm                         Gm
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
A7                             Dm
Your rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
                               Gm
You say, “What did you do with him today?”
    A7                        Dm
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

 [Pre-Chorus]
Gmaj7
Cause you're my fella, my guy
E7
Hand me your stella and fly
F
By the time I'm out the door
    E                 A7
You tear me down like Roger Moore

 [Chorus]
Dm             Am       E7     Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
  Dm            Am           E7               Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good

 [Verse]
Dm                   Gm
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
A7                    Dm
He's in a place but I can't get joy
                       Gm
Thinking on you in the final throes
A7              Dm
This is when my buzzer goes

 [Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Run out to meet your chips and pitta
E7
You say, “When we're married,” cause you're not bitter
F
There'll be none of him no more
  E7                   A7
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

 [Chorus]
Dm             Am       E7     Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
  Dm            Am           E7               Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good

 [Verse]
Dm               Gm
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
A7                Dm
We're like how we were again
                    Gm
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
A7                  Dm
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

 [Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Then you notice little carpet burn
E7
My stomach drops and my guts churn
F
You shrug and it's the worst
    E7              A7
Who truly stuck the knife in first

 [Chorus]
Dm             Am       E7     Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
  Dm            Am           E7               Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
Dm             Am       E7     Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
  Dm            Am           E7               Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
