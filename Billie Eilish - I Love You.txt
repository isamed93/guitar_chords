[Verse 1]
     Fmaj7
It's not true
                   Cmaj7
Tell me I’ve been lied to
             Fmaj7       Cmaj7
Crying isn't like you, ooh
                  Fmaj7
What the hell did I do?
               Cmaj7
Never been the type to
                Fmaj7            Cmaj7
Let someone see right through, ooh

[Chorus]
Fmaj7
Maybe, won't you take it back?

Say you were tryna make me laugh
G
And nothing has to change today
                               Am   Asus2
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
       C Cmaj7              Fmaj7  Cmaj7
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
   Fmaj7
Up all night
           Cmaj7
On another red-eye
                Fmaj7              Cmaj7
I wish we never learned to fly I-I-I
                     Fmaj7
Maybe we should just try
                    Cmaj7
To tell ourselves a good lie
                 Fmaj7             Cmaj7
I didn't mean to make you cry, I-I-I

[Chorus]
Fmaj7
Maybe, won't you take it back?

Say you were tryna make me laugh
G
And nothing has to change today
                               Am   Asus2
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
       C Cmaj7              Fmaj7  Cmaj7
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
     Dm
The smile that you gave me
     Em                   Fmaj7
Even when you felt like dying

[Outro]
Fmaj7----
We fall apart as it gets dark

I'm in your arms in Central Park
G
There's nothing you could do or say
                            Am---
I can’t escape the way, I love you
             C              Fmaj7  Cmaj7
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
