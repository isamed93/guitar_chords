[Pre-verse]
Em              G6             Cmaj7
   When I was a child, I heard voices,
Am                                B7
   Some would sing and some would scream.
Em          G6                Cmaj7
   You soon find you have few choices,
Am               Asus2            Em
   I learned the voices died with me.

[Verse 1]
Em              G6                Cmaj7
   When I was a child I'd sit for hours,
Asus2      Cmaj7     B7
   Staring into open flames.
Em           G6          Cmaj7
   Something in it had a power,
Asus2           B7           Em
   Could barely tear my eyes away.

[Chorus]
Em         G6           Cmaj7
   All you have is your fire,
Em         G                 B7
   And the place you need to reach.
Em           G6    Cmaj7
   Don't you ever, taaaame your demons,
Asus2     B7             Em
   Always keep them on a leash.

[Verse 2]
Em            G6           Cmaj7
   When i was 16 my senses fooled me,
Em              G             B7
   Thought gasoline was on my clothes.
Em                   G6               Cmaj7
   I knew that something would always rule me,
Asus2          B7           Em
   I knew this sin was mine alone.

[Chorus]
Em         G6           Cmaj7

Em         G                 B7
   And the place you need to reach.
Em           G6    Cmaj7
   Don't you ever, taaame your demons,
Asus2     B7             Em
   Always keep them on a leash.

[Verse 3]
Em              G6               Cmaj7
   When I was a man I thought it ended,
Em        G                  B7
   Well I knew loves perfect ache
Em                  G6     Cmaj7
   But my peace has always depended,
Asus2         B7          Em
   on all the ashes in my wake

[Chorus]
Em         G6           Cmaj7
   All you have is your fire,
Em         G                 B7
   And the place you need to reach.
Em           G6    Cmaj7
   Don't you ever, taaaame your demons,
Asus2     B7             Em
   Always keep them on a leash.
