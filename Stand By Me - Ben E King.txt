Capo : II
[Verse 1]
            G        G                  Em    Em
When the night has come and the land is dark
          C         D    G           G
And the moon is the only light we'll see
        G       G            Em         Em
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
        C             D    G             G
Just as long as you stand, stand by  me. So darlin', darlin'
 
[Chorus 1]
G            G      Em       Em
stand by me, oh now stand by me,
C            D        G          G
stand by me, stand by me.
 
[Verse 2]
           G       G         Em                Em
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
             C          D         G      G
And the mountain should crumble into the sea
             G            G     Em           Em
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
        C             D          G      G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me. And darling, darling
 
[Chorus 2]
G            G      Em       Em
stand by me, oh now stand by me,
C            D        G          G
stand by me, stand by me.
