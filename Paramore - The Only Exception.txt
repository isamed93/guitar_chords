[Intro]
G  G  Dm  Cmaj7  x2
 
[Verse 1]
G                                 Dm                    Cmaj7
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
   G                                                Dm          Cmaj7
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it
    G                                      Dm         Cmaj7
And my mama swore that she would never let herself forget
    G                                                  Dm
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
                Cmaj7
if it does not exist, but darling
 
[Chorus]
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7
You are the only exception
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7           G
You are the only exception
 
[Verse 2]
G                                 Dm                   Cmaj7
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
    G                                         Dm                     Cmaj7
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
    G                                        Dm        Cmaj7
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
    G                                              Dm              Cmaj7
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
 
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
 
[Chorus]
      G
Well, you are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7
You are the only exception
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7       Am
You are the only exception
 
[Instrumental]
(Am) Am  G  D
 Am  Am  G  D
 
[Bridge]
           Am
I've got a tight grip on reality, but I can't
    G                           D
Let go of what's in front of me here
              Am
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
         G                                  D         C
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, whoa
 
[Chorus]
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7
You are the only exception
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7
You are the only exception
 
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7
You are the only exception
G
You are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7
You are the only exception
 
[Outro]
    Fadd#11   C              G
And I'm on my way to believing
        Fadd#11   C              G
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
