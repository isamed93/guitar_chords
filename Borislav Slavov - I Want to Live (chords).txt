Dm

[Verse 1]
Dm          F              C
I feel your breath upon my neck,
       Gm                Dm
a soft caress as cold as death.

Dm       C                  Bb
I didn't know you well back then,
           G               Dm
I blame it all on luck and vain.

     C                  Dm
Your blood like wine, I wanted in,
   F               Gm                Dm
oh darling, get me drunk and make me feel!

     C                 Dm
It's not my fault, I'm not to blame,
      C                Dm
These ain't my sins, I broke my chains!

        F              Gm              Dm
There's more to do and I still want to live.


[Verse 2]
Dm          F              C
I feel your breath upon my neck,
       Gm                Dm
a soft caress as cold as death.
Dm          C                Bb
I feel your heart beat in my soul,
            G                Dm
our futures bound, our bodies known.

     C                  Dm
Your blood like wine, I wanted in.
   F              Gm               Dm
Oh darling get me drunk, Invite me in!

     C                 Dm
It's not my fault, I'm not to blame,
      C                Dm
These ain't my sins, I broke my chains!

        F             Gm         Dm
There's more to do if I can only live.


[Bridge]
  G                   Dm
I can't go yet, don't let me die!
     G             Dm
I'll never stop, until I'm done!

    F      C        Bb              A
But just tonight maybe I'll rest in peace.



[Verse 3]
Dm          F              C
I feel your breath upon my neck,
       Gm                Dm
a soft caress as cold as death.
Dm          C                Bb
I feel your heart beat in my soul,
            G                Dm
our futures bound, our bodies known.

  C                   Dm
I can't go yet, don't let me die!
  C                Dm
I want to live! My only one!

        F              Gm          Dm
There's more to do, if we can only live.
    F                    Gm              Dm
The clock won't stop and this is what we get...
