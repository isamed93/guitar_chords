[Intro]
F     G      F      G


[Verse]
F            G
Now here you go again
       F               G
You say you want your freedom
F            G                 F        G
Well, who am I to keep you down?
F             G                 F                 G
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
       F        G             F
But listen carefully to the sound
         G                  F                    G
Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat, drives you mad
          F           G                    F      G
In the stillness of remembering what you had
              F           G
And what you lost
              F           G
And what you had
              F           G
And what you lost


[Chorus]
    Fmaj7          G6               Fmaj7          G
Oh  thunder only happens when it's raining
Fmaj7         G6                    Fmaj7          G
Players only love you when they're playing
    Fmaj7             G6               Fmaj7      G
Say women they will come and they will go
Fmaj7             G6                  Fmaj7        G
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
       Fmaj7
You'll know

[Verse]
F          G
Now here I go again
   F               G
I see your crystal visions
F          G             F          G
I keep my visions to myself
F           G                F                 G
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and,
F             G                    F
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell
            G               F                    G
Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad
        F             G                    F           G
In the stillness of remembering what you had
              F          G
And what you lost
              F          G
And what you had
                  F          G
Ooh, and what you lost


[Chorus]
     Fmaj7           G6               Fmaj7          G
Oh,  thunder only happens when it's raining
Fmaj7         G6                     Fmaj7          G
Players only love you when they're playing
     Fmaj7             G6               Fmaj7       G
Say, women, they will come and they will go
Fmaj7             G6                  Fmaj7         G
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

      Fmaj7            G6             Fmaj7          G
Oh,  thunder only happens when it's raining
Fmaj7         G6                     Fmaj7          G
Players only love you when they're playing
     Fmaj7             G6               Fmaj7       G
Say, women, they will come and they will go
Fmaj7             G6                 Fmaj7      G
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
       Fmaj7     G
You'll know
         Fmaj7   G
You will know
       Fmaj7
Ahh, you'll know
