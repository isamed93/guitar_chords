[Intro]
Em C#dim C  B7

[Verse 1]
          Em                   C#dim
I can't believe we're finally alone
          C                   B7
I can't believe I almost went home
             Em                  C#dim
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
                  C            B7
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)


[Pre-Chorus 1]
    Em                   C#dim
The universe must have divined this
C
What am I gonna do?
B7
Not grab your wrist?


[Chorus]
Em                                 C#dim
I could be a better boyfriend than him
                         C
I could do the shit that he never did
D            B7
Up all night, I won't quit
Em                                C#dim
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
                  C
I could be such a gentleman
N.C.
Plus all my clothes would fit


[Post-Chorus]
Em C#dim  C B7
            I could be a better boyfriend


[Verse 2]
Em
I don't need to tell you twice
C#dim
All the ways hе can't suffice
   C
   If I could give you some advicе
B7
I would leave with me tonight


[Pre-Chorus 2]
    Em                   C#dim
The universe must have divined this
        C
        Mm, mm, mm
                    N.C.
Ladies first, baby, I insist


[Chorus]
Em                                 C#dim
I could be a better boyfriend than him
                         C
I could do the shit that he never did
D             B7
Up all night, I won't quit
Em                                C#dim
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
                  C
I could be such a gentleman
N.C.
Plus all my clothes would fit


[Post-Chorus]
Em C#dim  C B7                                 Em
            I could be a better boyfriend than him
C#dim C

D                   Bb
I could be a better boyfriend


[Bridge]
Am                 Em        B7
I never would have left you alone

Here on your own
              Am
Glued to your phone
                 Em         B7
Never would have left you alone
                             A7
For someone else to take you home


[Chorus]
Em                                 C#dim
I could be a better boyfriend than him
                         C
I could do the shit that he never did
D             B7
Up all night, I won't quit
Em                       C#dim
I'm gonna steal you from him
                  C
I could be such a gentleman
N.C.
Plus you know my clothes would fit

Em                                 C#dim
I could be a better boyfriend than him
                         C
I could do the shit that he never did
D             B7
Up all night, I won't quitt
Em                                C#dim
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
                  C
I could be such a gentleman
N.C.
Plus all my clothes would fit
