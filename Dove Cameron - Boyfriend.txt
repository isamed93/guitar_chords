[Intro]
Gm Edim Eb D

[Verse 1]
          Gm                   Edim
I can't believe we're finally alone
          Eb                  D
I can't believe I almost went home
             Gm                  Edim
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
                  Eb           D
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)


[Pre-Chorus 1]
    Gm                   Edim
The universe must have divined this
Eb
What am I gonna do?
Gbdim
Not grab your wrist?


[Chorus]
Gm                                 Eb
I could be a better boyfriend than him

I could do the shit that he never did
D            Bb
Up all night, I won't quit
Gm                                Eb
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
                  Cm
I could be such a gentleman
N.C.
Plus all my clothes would fit


[Post-Chorus]
Gm Eb Cm D                   Bb

I don't need to tell you twice

All the ways hе can't suffice
   Eb
If I could give you some advicе
D
I would leave with me tonight


[Pre-Chorus 2]
    Gm                   Cm
The universe must have divined this

Mm, mm, mm

Ladies first, baby, I insist


[Chorus]
Gm                                 Eb

Cm                 Gm        Dm
I never would have left you alone

Here on your own
              Cm
Glued to your phone
                 Gm         A
Never would have left you alone
                             A7
For someone else to take you home


[Chorus]
Gm                                  Eb
