[Chorus]
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     G                                  Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Am      C       G      Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
   G                   Em             Am
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse]
       Am        C
Your beauty is beyond compare
       G                Am
With flaming locks of auburn hair
       G             Em              Am
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
       Am             C
Your smile is like a breath of spring
       G                  Am
Your voice is soft like summer rain
       G         Em             Am
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse]
    Am             C
He talks about you in his sleep
     G                Am
There's nothing I can do to keep
       G             Em               Am
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
    Am            C
And I can easily understand
    G                 Am
How you could easily take my man
         G                  Em           Am
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

[Chorus]
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
      G                                 Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                    Em             Am
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse]
Am                    C
You could have your choice of men
    G              Am
But I could never love again
   G           Em           Am
He's the only one for me, Jolene
   Am               C
I had to have this talk with you
    G           Am
My happiness depends on you
        G          Em            Am
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

[Chorus]
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
      G                                 Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                    Em            Am
Please don't take him even though you can
