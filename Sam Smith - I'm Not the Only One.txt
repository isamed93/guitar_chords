[Verse 1]

C   E         Am           F7
   You and me we made a vow
C       E        Am       F7
   For better or for worse
C     E            Am             F7
   I can't believe you let me down
             C              G      C
But the proof is in the way it hurts

C       E            Am             F7
   For months on end I've had my doubts
C     E         Am       F7
   Denying every tear
C     E                Am         F7
   I wish this would be over now
           C                G        C
   But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]

    C  E      Am   F7
You say I'm crazy
       C                E               Am    F7
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     C  E      Am      F7
But when you call me baby
    C               G    C
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]

C          E          Am       F7
   You've been so unavailable
C       E           Am         F7
   Now sadly I know why
C        E             Am      F7
   Your heart is unobtainable
          C        G          C
Even though lord knows you have mine

[Chorus]

    C  E      Am   F7
You say I'm crazy
       C                E               Am    F7
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     C  E      Am      F7
But when you call me baby
    C               G    C
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]

F7                        C
   I have loved you for many years
 E                    Am      G
Maybe I am just not enough
F7                               C
   You've made me realise my deepest fear
    G
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]

    C  E      Am   F7
You say I'm crazy
       C                E               Am    F7
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     C  E      Am      F7
But when you call me baby
    C               G    C
I know I'm not the only one

    C  E      Am   F7
You say I'm crazy
       C                E               Am    F7
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     C  E      Am      F7
But when you call me baby
    C               G    C
I know I'm not the only one
   C               E    Am      F7
I know I'm not the only one
   C               E    Am      F7
I know I'm not the only one
      C                     E               Am         G           F7
And I know And I know And I know And I know And I know And I know know
    C               G    C
I know I'm not the only one
