[Verse 1]
          Cmaj7                                          Dm7
Well, sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
      Cmaj7                                                                Dm7
And I think of all the things, what you're doin' and in my head I paint a picture


[Chorus]
     F                                Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         F                               Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       Em                         G
 Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
G7                             Cmaj7         Dm7
Why don't you come on over, Va-a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee
   Cmaj7         Dm7
Va-a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee


[Verse 2]
        Cmaj7                                                                  Dm7
Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer
           Cmaj7                                                               Dm7
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ya
        Cmaj7                                                Dm7
Are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, are you busy?
            Cmaj7                                                             Dm7
And did you have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?


[Chorus]
     F                                Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         F                               Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       Em                         G
 Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
G7                             Cmaj7         Dm7
Why don't you come on over, Va-a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee
   Cmaj7         Dm7
Va-a-lerie, Valerie-e-ee

Well, sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water

Why don't you come on over Va-alerie...
