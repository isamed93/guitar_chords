Bb X13331

[Intro]
Dm  Gm  Bb  A

[Verse 1]
Dm                     Gm
 He left no time to re-gret,
              Bb                          A
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe bet.
Dm                 Gm
 Me... and my head high,
             Bb                  A
And my tears dry; get on without my guy.

[Verse 2]
Dm                         Gm
 You went back to what you knew,
       Bb                             A
So far removed, from all that we went through.
    Dm                    Gm
And I... tread a troubled track,
            Bb                    A
My odds are stacked; I'll go back to black.

[Chorus 1]
Dm                         Gm
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
Bb                     A             N.C.           Dm
 You go back to her and I go back to...I go back to us.

[Verse 3]
Dm          Gm
 I love you much,
           Bb                         A
It's not e-nough; you love blow and I love puff.
    Dm             Gm
And life is like a pipe,
               Bb                         A
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside.

[Chorus 2]
Dm                         Gm
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
Bb                      A
 You go back to her and I go back to...
Dm                         Gm
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
Bb                      A            Dm
 You go back to her and I go back to black.
