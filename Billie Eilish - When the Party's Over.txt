[Intro]
F    Am    C    F    x2

[Verse 1]
F        Am       C       F
Don't ya know I'm no good for you.
     F          Am        C       F
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
F       Am       C        F
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
    F       Am   C         F
But nothing ever stops you leaving

[Chorus]
  F                      Am       C     F
Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
F        Am       C      F
Don't ya know too much already
     F    Am       C      F
I'll only hurt you if you let me
F       Am          C       F
Call me friend, but keep me closer
C
(Call me back)
         F        Am       C       F
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
    F           Am           C         F
Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
Dm             Am          C      F
But nothing is better, sometimes
Dm              Am           C    F
Once we've both said our goodbyes
G                 F  F#dim
Let's just let it go
G              F
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
F                       Am         C       F
Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own (my own)
Dm                         Am            C           F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
Dm                  Am                     C              (F)
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
