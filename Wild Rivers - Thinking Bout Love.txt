[Verse 1]
         E                      F#m7
Guess we caught up with telling a lie
                      C#m    A
Now you're leaving me lonely
                  E                    F#m7
I could get in my car and get drunk at some bar
                 C#m    A
But that was the old me
             E                   F#m7
Remember the night that we slept on the floor
                    C#m      A
And you told me you loved me
E               F#m7                   C#m A
  But you don't ever think 'bout that

[Chorus]
B             C#m
  It's kinda like a light went off
               A                 E
And now you're deadset on giving me up
B          C#m
  Talking like we're so far gone and
            A                E
There ain't no use stitching it up
B          C#m
  We could do the long haul
                 A
We could ride it out
                  E              B C#m
I know the ride's rough, but try us
                             A      E
You're just thinking 'bout tomorrow

[Verse 2]
           E                            F#m
I'm on the road while you're waiting at home
                    C#m        A
But I swear I'll be right back
                 E                         F#m
You'll find some man with no rock 'n' roll band
                 C#m     A
and maybe you'll like it
             E                       F#m
Remember the lake when it started to rain, babe
           C#m       A
And I just held you
E               F#m                   C#m A
  Bet you don't even think 'bout that

[Chorus]
B             C#m
  It's kinda like a light went off
               A                 E
And now you're deadset on giving me up
B          C#m
  Talking like we're so far gone and
            A                E
There ain't no use stitching it up
B          C#m
  We could do the long haul
                 A
We could ride it out
                  E              B C#m
I know the ride's rough, but try us
                             A      E
You're just thinking 'bout tomorrow

[Bridge]
                        B    C#m A E
I'm just thinking 'bout love
                        B    C#m A E
I'm just thinking 'bout love
B    C#m   A  E
  Oh-oh-oh-oh
B    C#m   A  E
  Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
B             C#m
  It's kinda like a light went off
               A                 E
And now you're deadset on giving me up
B          C#m
  Talking like we're so far gone and
            A                E
There ain't no use stitching it up
B          C#m
  We could do the long haul
                 A
We could ride it out
                  E              B C#m
I know the ride's rough, but try us

[Outro]
                          A                      E
You're just thinking 'bout, I'm just thinking 'bout
                        B    C#m A E
I'm just thinking 'bout love
                        B    C#m A E
I'm just thinking 'bout love
                        B    C#m A E
I'm just thinking 'bout love
                        B    C#m A E
I'm just thinking 'bout love
