Capo IV
[Verse 1]
          Am
All I can ever be to you
     Dm
Is a darkness that we knew
    F             Am  Cmaj7
And this regret I got accustomed to
Am
Once it was so right
     Dm
When we were at our height
F               Am     Cmaj7
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
         Am
I knew I hadn't met my match
          Dm
But every moment we could snatch
  F              Am    Cmaj7
I don't know why I got so attached
            Am
It's my responsibility
              Dm
And you don't owe nothing to me
       F           Am        Cmaj7
But to walk away I have no capacity

[Chorus]
   F      Dm    Em
He walks away
        Am
The sun goes down
 F   Dm              Em       Am
He takes the day but I'm grown
           F    Dm       Em        Am
And in your way, in this blue shade
   C                  F
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 2]
Am
I don't understand
    Dm
Why do I stress the man
     F               Am     Cmaj7
When there's so many bigger things at hand
              Am
We could have never had it all
   Dm
We had to hit a wall
   F         Am      Cmaj7
So this is inevitable withdrawal
          Am
Even if I stop wanting you
    Dm
And perspective pushes through
     F            Am            Cmaj7
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
          Am
I can not play myself again
  Dm
I should just be my own best friend
    F           Am              Cmaj7      Em
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

[Chorus]
   F      Dm    Em
He walks away
        Am
The sun goes down
 F   Dm      Em      Am
He takes the day but I'm grown
           F    Dm       Em        Am
And in your way, in this blue shade
   C                  F
My tears dry on their own

[Bridge]
   F
So we are history

Your shadow covers me
    E
The sky above a blaze...

[Chorus]
   F      Dm    Em
He walks away
        Am
The sun goes down
 F   Dm      Em      Am
He takes the day but I'm grown
           F    Dm       Em        Am
And in your way, in this blue shade
   C                  F
My tears dry on their own

[Verse 3]
         Am
I wish I could say no regrets
       Dm
And no emotional debts
      F              Am      Cmaj7
Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
   Am
So we are history
    Dm
The shadow covers me
    Fm          Am              Cmaj7
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see

[Chorus]
   F      Dm    Em
He walks away
        Am
The sun goes down
 F   Dm      Em      Am
He takes the day but I'm grown
           F    Dm       Em        Am
And in your way, in this blue shade
   C                  F
My tears dry on their own

   F      Dm    Em
He walks away
        Am
The sun goes down
 F   Dm      Em      Am
He takes the day but I'm grown
           F    Dm       Em        Am
And in your way, in this blue shade

   F     Dm   Em    Am
My tears dry
