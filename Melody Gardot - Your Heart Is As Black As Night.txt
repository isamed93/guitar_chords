Capo on 3rd fret

[Verse]
   Am           E7
Your eyes may be whole
C                  Dm
But the story Im told
          C        E7        Am      E7
Is your heart is as black as night
      Am           E7
Your lips might be sweet
          C         Dm
Such that I cant compete
          C        E7          Am        E7
But your heart is as black as night

[Chorus]
    Dm                           Am
I dont know why you came along at such a perfect time
    Dm                           E7
But if I let you hang around Im bound to lose my mind

[Verse]
            Am            E7
Cause your hands may be strong
         C            Dm
But the feelings all wrong
      Am/C       E7         Am          E7
Your heart is as black as night

   Dm                            Am
I dont know why you came along at such a perfect time
    Dm                            E7
But if I let you hang around Im bound to lose my mind

[Verse]
            Am              E7
Cause your hands may be strong
         C             Dm
But the feelings all wrong
     C          E7
Your heart is as black
     C           Dm
Your heart is as black
        Am/C         E7         Am
Oh, Your heart is as black as night
